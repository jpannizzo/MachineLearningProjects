## Overview
Reinforced learning AI created using gym, nes_py, and stable_baselines3. AI's goal is to beat Super Mario Brothers.

## Tensorboard Data
Tensorboard data can be found in the logs folder. Completed training runs can be found in the completed folder. Completed training runs will have the log file name as a part of its name. Log folders are generated at the beginning of each run.

# Before installing stable_baseline3
Install PyTorch through their website first in order to use your GPU for reinforced learning. After that run requirements.txt. 
Will still work if you just use requirements.txt but it will only use your CPU instead of your GPU.
