Reinforced learning AI created using gym, nes_py, and stable_baselines3. AI's goal is to beat Super Mario Brothers.

# Before installing stable_baseline3
Install PyTorch through their website first in order to use your GPU for reinforced learning. After that run requirements.txt. 
Will still work if you just use requirements.txt but it will only use your CPU instead of your GPU.
